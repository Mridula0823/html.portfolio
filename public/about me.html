<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is JAYANI MRIDULA, and I am a budding web developer with a passion for creating beautiful, functional, and user-friendly websites.

  My Journey
  I started my journey into web development driven by a curiosity to understand how websites work and a desire to build my own online presence. Every step of the way, from learning HTML to experimenting with CSS and diving into JavaScript, has been a thrilling adventure.
  
  My Philosophy
  I believe in the power of the internet to connect people and ideas. I strive to make the web a better place by crafting websites that are not only visually appealing but also accessible and easy to use. I am committed to continuous learning and improvement, always looking for new techniques and technologies to enhance my skills.
  
  <h2>What I Do</h2>
  HTML & CSS: Building the structure and styling of web pages.<br>
  JavaScript: Adding interactivity and dynamic features.<br>
  Responsive Design: Ensuring websites look great on any device.<br>
  Learning & Experimenting: Constantly exploring new tools and frameworks to stay updated with the latest trends in web development.<br>
  
  <H2>Future Goals</H2>
