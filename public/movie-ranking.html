<h1>THE MOST EMOTIONALLY CONNECTED SERIES ACCORDING TO JAYANI</h1>

<h2>My top 3 series of all time</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>VINCENZO</h3>
<p>The drama was actually fully engaged, unlike some some series that have scenes to just make u sleep.</p>

<h3>TRUE BEAUTY</h3>
<p>This drama just gave all the females out there a sense of women empowerment that was depicted strongly</p>

<h3>Sen cal kapimi</h3>
<p>This was one of the 1st turkish series I've ever watched in my lifetime, I generally like watching dramas based on women empowerment<br/>this was the series where women doesn't give up that easily on anything.They're determined and focused on their goals no matter what ever distractions or obstacles they faced.</p>
